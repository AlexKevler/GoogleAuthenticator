Ported from http://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/

You can use the Google Authenticator app from here
http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1066447
to generate One Time Passwords/Tokens and check them with this little
PHP app (Of course, you can also create them with this).

There are many real world applications for that, but noone implemented it yet.

See example.php for how to use it.
